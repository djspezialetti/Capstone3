# Capstone3

### Project Overview
This program mainly utilizes the Spring Framework and Java to display a custom Videogame Store website. The user can view the website and do the following:

> View the various products on the home page and refine their search by product category or prices via the slider

If the user has an account, they can do the following:

> Add products to their cart, view their cart, and delete products from their cart

It should be noted, that the front-end of this project, the database, and most of the structure of this program was already created. This capstone is intended to highlight my knowledge on the Spring Framework and using a Spring Boot application.
Some data within the database was altered by myself for a more personalized feeling.


Below are some screenshots of the front-end website and the program running in IntelliJ for a visual reference.
